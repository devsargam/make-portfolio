This project is called portfolio maker where people can input relevent information and we will bascially cook them a good server side rendered portfolio instantly.

This is a nextjs 15 project with app router
- better auth for authentication
- drizzle orm for database
- shadcn for ui components
- tailwindcss for styling

Always prefer to use react server components over client components
Always create server action instead of creating api route
Write clean and maintainable code as compared to performant
Always check for authentication in required pages
